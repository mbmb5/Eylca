Extend Your Lumix Camera's Abilities

## Disclaimer
This application is *unofficial*.
It is not an official Panasonic product, and it is not approved by or associated with Panasonic in any way.
For basic camera control over wifi, please use the official app instead.

## Goals
This app aims at using wifi control to add features to a Lumix camera.
Such features would be:
- motion detection (implemented)
- focus bracketing (not implemented yet)
- scripting (not implemented yet)

## Use
Connect your phone to the wifi of your camera and disable the mobile data.
Start the app.
If nothing appears, go to the settings and change the ip value to the one of your camera.

When in motion detection activity, the parameters values are changed on the fly (no need to restart motion detection if it is already started).
Please note that you can do something else on your phone while motion detection is activated, but don't forget to stop it afterwards ;-)

## Camera support
I can only test the app on the FZ1000, but it should work with most of Lumix cameras.
